Charmander - Scheduler Lab
==========================

Charmander is a lab environment for measuring and analyzing resource-scheduling algorithms.
The project got started at the Foundry as an internship project in 2014 by Thedora Chu.

Charmander at its core provides an easy to use environment to a) schedule and deploy compute-tasks in a multi-node setup
and b) measure the corresponding cpu, memory, and network-loads.

The collected measurements can afterwards be analyzed using the included Spark analytics workbench and subsequently
those results can be feed back in to the scheduler.
